Food-Delivery

It is a Full Stack MERN project.
I used Vite for this project.
I used React.js for Frontend and used Node.js, Express.js for Backend and MongoDB as Database for collecting images of food items, user data and orders data.
I used Context for adding cart functionality. 
I used jsonwebtoken for user authentication.
It has admin panel where admin can add food items, remove food items in menu, and also can update the status of the order.
